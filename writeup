Dashboard 1
Bike trips reduced by 59% (6887) from 11,624 in Jan to 4737 in Feb 2021.
In addition, subscriber use dropped by 88% (8,552) in the same period. Given numbers 
were stable at the start of winter, between Dec 2020 and Jan 2021, it may be possible
Jersey City is experiencing socioeconomic hardship and/or lockdowns as a result of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Further investigation into the impact of this reduction on
revenue is waranted. In addition, users aged 51 years old comprised 22% (6,232) of all users 
over the winter season. The next most common age of users was 29 years comprising 5% (1,424)
of all users. Given the substantial difference further investigation into past data should be 
performed to determine if this is an anamoly in the system and/or false reporting
by users.
